# VORON Kit Completeness Helper

Small collection of tools to get your Voron parts all sorted out.


Printing your first set of VORON parts can be tedious and overwhelming. Do I have all parts for that assembly step? Do I have to choose one of these parts? Where have I put the <insert part name>?

But there is help.

From the experience of printing multiple kits per week, we came up with a "quality management" system that helps us assuring all kits are shipped complete and can help you to sort out your very first VORON print experience.

The folders contain commented slicer screenshots showing all the necessary parts for your build, assorted into the different categories and assembly subunits. When parts are optional or there is a choce to make, this is noted too. Currently, all current VORON printers are include (2.4, Trident, 0.1) as well as the Stealthburner and the TAP. The Enderwire will be added later.
Simply print the images on standard DIN A4 paper and place every part in it's dedicated spot. Make sure to use the "scale to fit paper" option to ensure that everything fits as intended.
